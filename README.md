This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (==) when comparing null and undefined values. The bug.js file contains the problematic code, while bugSolution.js offers a corrected version using strict equality (===). The loose equality operator (==) performs type coercion before comparison, leading to unexpected results in this case.  The strict equality operator (===) avoids type coercion, resulting in more predictable and reliable comparisons.
